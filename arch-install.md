Breakdown

-D: Driver Name ("driver1") or Driver Names ("driver1,driver2)
nl80211 is the netlink interface 802.11 driver for linux
wext, or The Wireless Extension (WE), is a generic API allowing a driver to expose to the user space, configuration and statistics specific to common Wireless LANs. As far as I know, it is being phased out.

-i: interface

-c: configuration file
In this case, we used the wpa_passphrase command to generate the config on the fly
